ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is developing an application to allow users to like posts. 
Based on comprehensive market research, we've determined that most 
social/chatting apps like Twitter, Snapchat, and WhatsApp are going out of 
style; customers now want a more nostalgic experience where they can only 
like individual posts with more restrictions than modern chatting apps. 
Who knows, if BuffChat is a success, we could even expand to have a real 
company!
